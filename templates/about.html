<h2>{{ page_title }}</h2>
<p>The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in
    recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the King under the Mountain when Smaug
    came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire, Gandalf
    decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force. Gandalf
    also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash action. The
    superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to leave on other
    business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.</p>

        <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
        <p>Thorin II was born in TA 2746 to the Dwarf prince Thráin II in the city of the Lonely Mountain. Early in his
            youth, Thorin and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug, in TA
            2770. While in exile, he quickly grew into a capable warrior. This was demonstrated at the Battle of
            Azanulbizar, near Moria, in TA 2799. He fought with one of the Dwarven armies beneath Moria's East-gate, and
            at some point in the battle, his shield broke, and, using an oaken tree branch found on the ground as a
            shield, he gained the epithet "Oakenshield," which remained with him even in death.</p>

        <h3>Fíli and Kíli</h3>
        <p>Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their mother, Dís. They were also nephews
            of Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II, and great-grandsons of Thrór. Fíli's most distinguishing feature was his
            long nose, the longest of any of the Dwarves in Thorin's company.</p>

        <h3>Óin</h3>
        <p>Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle of Gimli. Óin's uncle was Fundin,
            the
            father of Balin and Dwalin.
            Óin fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield, and in TA 2941 joined Thorin's
            company on
            the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain, wearing a brown hood.[2] Óin was one of the Dwarves who bet that
            Bilbo
            would come along with them to reclaim the Lonely Mountain. Óin and his brother Glóin were usually in charge
            of
            preparing the fire for the Company, as they were the most skilled of the group. He fought in and survived
            the
            Battle of Five Armies, and later settled in the Lonely Mountain with King Dáin II Ironfoot, along with many
            other Dwarves of the company of Thorin.</p>

            <h3>Gandalf</h3>
            <p>Originally called Olórin, he was accounted as the wisest of the Maiar. He was created by Ilúvatar before
                the Music of the Ainur,[1] and was at the beginning of Time amongst the Ainur who entered into Eä.[2] In
                his "youth" he became one of the Maiar who served Manwë, Varda, Irmo, and Nienna. He was associated with
                light and fire, much like Varda, yet his ways often took him to Nienna, from whom he learned pity and
                patience. He loved the Elves, but walked unseen among them, or wore the guise of an Elf, and sent them
                fair visions in their hearts that made them wiser. Throughout his life he followed the example of
                Nienna, talking pity on the sorrows of the Children of Ilúvatar and drawing those who listened to him
                out of despair.
                When the Valar decided to send the Istari (also called Wizards) to Middle-earth to counsel and assist
                all those who opposed the Dark Lord Sauron, Manwë and Varda included Olórin among the five to be sent.
                At first, Olórin was nervous and described himself as too weak and afraid of Sauron. Manwë understood,
                and told Olórin that such was a reason why he should go, to overcome that fear. Furthermore, the One
                Ring, containing much of Sauron's power, presumably still existed somewhere. Thus, Manwë insisted that
                Olórin should go as the third, but Varda convinced him to send Olórin as the second instead.[4] He
                agreed, and prepared for Olórin's departure from the Undying Lands with the other four, arriving about
                the same time that the Necromancer appeared in Mirkwood.</p>
